        <p>Energy Management systems help to deliver rich platform and browser-independent real-time visualization of energy use. Such software can address any application from a single building to an entire campus or multi-site enterprise. Energy Management
            system software involves solutions to monitor, analyze and improve organizational assets. It helps to optimize energy usage of buildings and equipment. It can help identify energy-related efficiency issues in production processes. It also
            helps to simplify workflow for field operatives. With these software tools, users can create IT firewall-friendly, secure custom energy dashboards and kiosks to view reports for analysis of energy consumption patterns, resource usage, and
            progress on sustainability efforts. Site managers, building engineers or maintenance personnel can quickly and intuitively navigate energy-related data and discover opportunities for improvement.
